## Scope Plane
I identified 2 main pages were needed for the website to be able to functon as required;

Review page
* A page for each film where a films details can be viewed.
* Reviews can be viewed on the film on the page.
* Only logged in users can leave reviews.

New film page
* A page where an admin can only access to add new films.

For the site to fucntion well and a good user experience, the other pages needed were;
